<p>I am in the process of making good on my promise to actually liberate the data from the Horizon Report projects. I'm still learning how to code some of the pieces, but in the next week or so, there should be fully functioning JSON, YAML, and APIs with the data from the K-12 and higher education reports, dating back to 2004.</p>

<p>These will be drawn from two new repositories I've created:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Hack-Education-Data/horizon-report-higher-ed">horizon-report-higher-ed</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Hack-Education-Data/horizon-report-k12">horizon-report-k12</a></li>
</ul>

<p>One of the issues I'm still struggling with: how much data should I pull from each report. Are people really just interested in the list of six trends? Do they want a description of the trends? <a href="http://github.com/hackeducation/horizon">You can always leave feedback on the GitHub repository that powers this site</a>, you know.</p>
