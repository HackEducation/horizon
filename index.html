<p>Every year when the NMC <a href="http://www.nmc.org/publications/">Horizon Report</a> comes out, I wonder how the predictions compare to previous years. It's not so much that they're always wrong. (Predictions about the future almost always are.) It's that without a nod to the history of those predictions, it's hard to see the report as much more than an embrace of the narrative that "everything changes; new procurement is inevitable."</p>

<p>This project was first conceived to liberate the Horizon Report data from PDFs (the future still seems to involve PDFs, dammit) and make the information machine-readable and visualize-able.</p>

</ul>

<p>In the meantime, admire this nice chart I made of the history of the Horizon Report's predictions about the future of technology in higher education:</p>
