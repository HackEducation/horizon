<p>Every year when the NMC <a href="http://www.nmc.org/publications/">Horizon Report</a> comes out, I wonder how the predictions compare to previous years. This project will liberate that data from old PDFs and make it machine-readable and visualize-able.</p>

<p>You can find a list of <a href="http://horizon.hackeducation.com/links.html">links to previous years' reports here</a>. And you can find my <a href="https://github.com/audreywatters/horizon">GitHub repo here</a>. I also maintain a <a href="http://horizon.hackeducation.com/blog/">blog</a> where I chronicle the various updates to this project (which at the moment online looks at the K-12 and Higher Ed reports).</p>

<p>In the meantime, admire this nice chart I made for the higher education trends:</p>
