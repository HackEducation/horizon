[{"Horizon":"One Year or Less","Trend":"BYOD","Description":"BYOD, also referred to as BYOT (Bring Your Own Technology), refers to the practice of people bringing their own laptops, tablets, smartphones, or other mobile devices with them to the learning or work environment. Intel coined the term in 2009, when the company observed that an increasing number of its employees were using their own devices and connecting them to the corporate network. Since implementing BYOD policies, the company has reported up to 5 million hours of annual productivity gains, a statistic that is compelling many other companies to consider BYOD.

{"Horizon":"One Year or Less","Trend":"Cloud Computing","Description":"Cloud computing refers to expandable, on- demand services and tools that are served to the user via the Internet from specialized data centers and consume almost no local processing or storage resources. Cloud computing resources support collaboration, file storage, virtualization, and access to computing cycles, and the number of available applications that rely on cloud technologies has grown to the point that few education institutions do not make some use of the cloud, whether as a matter of policy or not.

{"Horizon":"Two to Three Years","Trend":"Learning Analytics","Description":"Learning analytics is an educational application of web analytics, a science that is commonly used by businesses to analyze commercial activities, identify spending trends, and predict consumer behavior. Education is embarking on a similar pursuit into data science with the aim of learner profiling, a process of gathering and analyzing large amounts of detail about individual student interactions in online learning activities. The goal is to build better pedagogies, empower students to take an active part in their learning, target at-risk student populations, and assess factors affecting completion and student success.","URL":"http://cdn.nmc.org/media/2014-nmc-horizon-report-k12-EN.pdf","IMG":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/learning_analytics.png "},
{"Horizon":"Four to Five Years","Trend":"The Internet of Things","Description":"The Internet of Things is a network of connected objects that link the physical world with the world of information through the web. The advent of TCP/IP v6, launched in 2006, expanded the capabilities of the Internet, and enabled objects, sensors, and devices to be addressable and thus findable across the Internet. This augmented address space is particularly useful for tracking objects that monitor sensitive equipment or materials, point-of-sale purchases, passport tracking, inventory management, identification, and similar applications.
